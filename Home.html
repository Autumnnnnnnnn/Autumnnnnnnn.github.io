<h1>About Me:</h1>



<p> Born in Miami,Florida but moved to New York in 2014. I'm a recent high school graduate from Lincoln High School. I will be attending Borough of Manhattin Community College, then transferring to Spellman College which is a HBCU. I still am undecided on which career path I want to walk upon, but I have interests in music, writing, teaching, business, and now computer science thanks to this program at KKCF.   </p>
