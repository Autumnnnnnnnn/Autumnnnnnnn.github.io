    <h2>Superhero</h2>
    <p>"If I could be a superhero for a day, I would try save as many people as I can. Swoosh in with my cape and try to break the cycle of curses that were placed-poverty, war, and discrimination just to name a few. A tangled knot that I must undo. Be kind,  honest, and true. A person that the younger genration can look up to. Not worried about the praise and fame, but with making the world a better place when I leave one day. I know I cannot save the world, but if I can save one life, or even make one smile, then I must did alright. If I could be a superhero for one day, I would like to ease the hardships and pain."</p>
