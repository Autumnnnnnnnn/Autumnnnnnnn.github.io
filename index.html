<h1>About Me:</h1>
<img src="about"



<p> Born on April 22nd, 2003 in Hollywood, Florida. Moved to New York in 2014. I'm a recent high school graduate from Lincoln High School. I will be attending Borough of Manhattin Community College, then transferring to Spellman College, a HBCU in Atlanta, Georgia. I still am undecided on which career path I want to walk upon, but I have interests in the arts, writing, teaching, business, and now computer science thanks to the program at KKCF. </p>
